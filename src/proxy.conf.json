/* This file was created to enable cross-origin sharing by proxying requests to the real town of babylon web site.
   Basically, I tried to use their search "api" at https://www.townofbabylon.com/Search/AutoComplete?term='xxx' to return documents that
   match the search string".  Unfortunately, this is a security exposure and the server (i.e. town of babylon website) need to recognize
   the request from my site with the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header.  Since I have no control over this, I'm using this alternate 
   method, by proxiying the town of babylon site, to get around this problem. But the true fix would be for the town of babylon site to
   return the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header acknowledging that the request coming from my site is valid 
   
   The approach used here is documented, about quarter of the way into the page, at 
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34790051/how-to-create-cross-domain-request
   
   **** Note the configuration file angular.json has been updated to add proxyConfig to the options property of the "serve" attribute 
        located under "build".  If this item is ever rolled back, you will also need to undo the changes to angular.json.  I couldn't add the 
        comment in the json file because it does not allow comments
